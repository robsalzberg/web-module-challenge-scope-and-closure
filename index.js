/**
 * ### Challenge `processFirstItem`
 * 
 * @instructions
 * Implement a higher-order function called `processFirstItem`.
 * It takes two arguments:
 * @param stringList an array of strings.
 * @param callback function that takes a string as its argument.
 * @returns the result of invoking `callback` with the FIRST element in `stringList`.
 * 
 * Example of usage of this higher-order function:
 * Invoking `processFirstItem` passing `['foo', 'bar']` and `(str) => str + str`,
 * should return 'foofoo'.

/* Task 1: `counterMaker`
 * Study the code for counter1 and counter2. Answer the questions below.
 * 
 * 1. What is the difference between counter1 and counter2?
 * 
 * The difference is that counter1 is a High Order Function.  A Higher-Order function
 * is a function that receives a function as an argument or returns the function as output.
 * 
 * 2. Which of the two uses a closure? How can you tell?
 * 
 * counter1 because it has an outer function that is being called by an inner function.
 * 
 * 3. In what scenario would the counter1 code be preferable? In what scenario would counter2 be better? 
 *
 * counter1 should be used when you need the function to be reuseable.
 * counter2 they are simpler to write and it is not always necessary to have closure.

Write a higher order function called `finalScore` that accepts the callback function `inning` (from above) and a number of innings and and returns the final score of the game in the form of an object.

For example,
